**Complete Guide to Network Penetration Testing**
-------------------------------------------------

### **1\. Networking Fundamentals**

#### **1.1 TCP/IP Suite**

*   **Example:**
    *   **TCP Three-Way Handshake:** When a client wants to establish a connection with a server, it sends a SYN packet. The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, and the client completes the handshake by sending an ACK packet.
    *   **Command:**
        *   To capture and analyze a TCP handshake in Wireshark:
            
            bash
            
            Copy code
            
            `tcpdump -i eth0 tcp and port 80`
            
        *   Then, open the capture in Wireshark to visualize the handshake.

#### **1.2 Subnetting & CIDR**

*   **Example:**
    *   **Subnetting:** If you have an IP address of `192.168.1.0/24`, the `/24` indicates that the first 24 bits are the network part, leaving 8 bits for host addresses, meaning you can have up to 254 usable IP addresses.
    *   **Comparison:**
        *   **/24 vs. /25 Subnetting:**
            *   **/24:** 256 total IPs, 254 usable (2 reserved for network and broadcast)
            *   **/25:** 128 total IPs, 126 usable
        *   **Command:**
            
            *   To calculate subnets, use:
            
            bash
            
            Copy code
            
            `ipcalc 192.168.1.0/24`
            

#### **1.3 Network Devices**

*   **Example:**
    *   **Router:** Routes traffic between different networks.
    *   **Firewall:** Filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules.
    *   **Switch:** Connects devices within a network and uses MAC addresses to forward data.
    *   **Command:**
        
        *   To view routing information on a Linux system:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `route -n`
        
        *   To view firewall rules on a Linux system:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `iptables -L`
        

### **2\. Network Scanning & Enumeration**

#### **2.1 Port Scanning**

*   **Example:**
    *   **SYN Scan:** Sends SYN packets to determine which ports are open.
    *   **Command:**
        
        *   Using Nmap for a SYN scan:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `nmap -sS 192.168.1.1`
        
    *   **Comparison:**
        *   **SYN Scan vs. TCP Connect Scan:**
            *   **SYN Scan:** Stealthier, only completes the handshake if the port is open.
            *   **TCP Connect Scan:** Completes the TCP handshake fully, more detectable.

#### **2.2 Service Enumeration**

*   **Example:**
    *   **Service Enumeration:** Identifying services running on open ports, such as HTTP on port 80 or SSH on port 22.
    *   **Command:**
        
        *   Using Nmap to enumerate services:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `nmap -sV 192.168.1.1`
        
    *   **Nikto:** Scan a web server for known vulnerabilities:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `nikto -h http://192.168.1.1`
        

#### **2.3 Banner Grabbing**

*   **Example:**
    *   **Banner Grabbing:** Retrieving service banners that may reveal software versions and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Command:**
        
        *   Using Netcat for banner grabbing:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `nc -v 192.168.1.1 22`
        
        *   You should see an SSH version banner, e.g., `SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.3`.
